WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net vga_c/clk_divider/r_25MHz_reg[1]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin vga_c/clk_divider/h_count_next[9]_i_2/O, cell vga_c/clk_divider/h_count_next[9]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT vga_c/clk_divider/h_count_next[9]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 20 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
vga_c/h_count_next_reg[0], vga_c/h_count_next_reg[1], vga_c/h_count_next_reg[2], vga_c/h_count_next_reg[3], vga_c/h_count_next_reg[4], vga_c/h_count_next_reg[5], vga_c/h_count_next_reg[6], vga_c/h_count_next_reg[7], vga_c/h_count_next_reg[8], vga_c/h_count_next_reg[9], vga_c/v_count_next_reg[0], vga_c/v_count_next_reg[1], vga_c/v_count_next_reg[2], vga_c/v_count_next_reg[3], vga_c/v_count_next_reg[4]... and (the first 15 of 20 listed)
